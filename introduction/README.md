# Introduction

There are several important things to do at the very beginning of the book. We need
to set a goal and explicitly define the steps we need to accomplish to meet the goal.
Goal should be simple, understandable, and (most importantly) *measurable* (otherwise
it would be ambiguous whether we achieved the goal or not).

Long things short, the goal of this book is:

> Define and create *project structure* and *build system* that helps you
> to follow *best practices* in software development for *Windows platform*.

That's very pretentious goal indeed :) Let's try to understand it better piece by piece.

## Project Structure
By *project structure* I understand the whole set of artefacts that comprise your
software project. It is very wide definition that includes source files, build scripts,
images, documentation, etc. All you want to put into source control system is, by
definition, part of the project structure.

## Build System

## Best Practices

## Well, I knew it was coming... Windows Platform
Yes, I know. Sorry for that, but that is the environment I know best and could
give some advices about. The good news is that a lot of the topics discussed in
the following chapters are applicable for other operating systems. You should
be able to grasp important concepts and reapply them in your particular environment.
A lot of the tools I'm going to mention are actually cross-platform, so they will
run as good (or better) in your favourite environment. Just stop blaming me and keep
reading!

## My Assumptions
I also have a couple of rules (you haven't thought that it would be *that* simple, right?).
Let me summarise them here:

 * I expect that you are able to tackle issues you may face in the process. I'm not
going to explain how to install tools, edit config files, etc. - please refer to official
documentation for that.
 * I don't plan to explain trivial things - I assume that you know the tools you are using.
For example, I expect that you know what .PDB file is and why it is important (or, if you
don't, you could find the missing pieces in different sources).

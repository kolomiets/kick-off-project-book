=====================

So, you have the Idea. Of course you do! You know all you need to know: programming
languages, various technologies, tools. You are accomplished professional or yesterday's
student - it does not matter. You know that you can do everything. You are the Programmer.

And you are right - you *really* can. And I'm not trying to mock you here. You will
get first version really fast - and more likely than none it will work (somehow,
anyhow at the very least). You will be able to release first version and a couple of
updates without much problems. But inevitable, and I'm sure you had exactly this feeling
many times (and will have much more, be sure of that), you will come to the following idea:

> God, I'd like to throw this piece of (*put your favorite word here*) out!
> I know **exactly** how my software should work and I can do it just right this time!

It is irresistible thought. And I can't say it is a bad one. More often than I would wish
that is the best thing to do. But the main question is

> How to do it *really* right this time?

That's the main goal of this small book. I'm not trying to sell you a silver bulet,
there is no one. What I'd like to share is a simple, but working approach of starting
a project that could save you and your teammates a lot of nerves and which gives you
full control and visibility over the project. More importantly, it gives you
some perspective and better understanding of how things work internally.

I hope that at the end of the day you will have stable, simple, flexible, useful,
and reusable project structure that will help you with day-to-day difficulties
you may face as a Software Developer (capital letters are intentional - that is our
profession, after all).

Enjoy it!

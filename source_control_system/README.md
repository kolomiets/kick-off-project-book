# Source Control System

Well, you need to keep your stuff somewhere. True, you might thing that your
home folder on local drive is a good place to put your project artefacts, but
surely there are better places.

To be honest, it does not matter whichever source control system you chose - we all have our preferences. [Git], [Subversion], even [TFS] will work great. The point is that without source control system team development is a nightmare (right, the worst one you can remember). Don't try it, really. There are far better things to waste your time on.

Sometimes we don't really have a freedom of choice - suppose that your company has a number [ClearCase] servers installed in different locations around the globe, forming big distributed system. In this situation you can't insist to use Git just because it is cool and you like it (well, you *can*, and probably in this particular situation you really *should*, but that is the topic for another book)

To keep things simple, I assume that you have [GitHub] account. If you still don't - create it right now, it is free and will take a couple of minutes.
